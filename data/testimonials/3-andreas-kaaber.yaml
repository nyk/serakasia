  The depth and quality of the lessons are outstanding. Even on a basic
  level, the theory is not of this world. It is truly a martial art that
  starts where all others end. My seniors in the art are truly fantastic
  people always willing to help and share, both their knowledge and life. 
  Serak is a unique brotherhood.

  After almost 40 years in martial arts, I feel very lucky to have found
  this amazing system. The depth and quality of the lessons are outstanding.
  Even on a basic level, the theory is out of this world. It is truly a
  martial art that starts where all others end. My seniors in the art
  are truly fantastic people always willing to help and share, both their
  knowledge and life. Serak is a unique brotherhood.
