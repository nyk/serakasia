  The training was great. Maha Guru Horacio always started with the basics
  and expanded on them from there. I really appreciated the family
  atmosphere. No egos and attitudes, just family getting together to train.
  If you ever have the chance to train with Maha Guru or Serak Asia,
  I would highly, highly recommend it.

  I just wanted to say what an extraordinarily great time I had at the Serak
  seminar in Chiang Mai.The training was great. Maha Guru always started with
  the basics and expanded on them from there (knowing I had almost no
  experience in Serak). I also like the way he tailored the seminar for the
  participants there. Asking us what we needed to work on and what we where
  interested in. I personally was interested in the blade work and time and
  time again Maha Guru went out of his way to show me the blade usage in all
  the movements and structures he was teaching. Even more so I really
  appreciated the family atmosphere there. No egos and attitudes, just family
  getting together to train. If you ever have the chance to train with Maha
  Guru or Serak Asia, I would highly, highly recommend it.
