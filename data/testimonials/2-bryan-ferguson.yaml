text: "The training was great. Maha Guru Horacio always started with the basics and expanded on them from there. I really appreciated the family atmosphere. No egos and attitudes, just family getting together to train. If you ever have the chance to train with Maha Guru or Serak Asia, I would highly, highly recommend it."
