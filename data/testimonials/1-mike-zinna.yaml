  Guru Nyk is very passionate about Serak and has a deep knowledge base
  and understanding of the art. On top of that he is a great educator and
  can effectively translate that knowledge into understandable and
  manageable chunks. If you have the opportunity I highly recommend
  training with Guru Nyk.

  I was excited when I found out about Serak Asia and Guru Nyk in Thailand.
  It is hard to find Silat training, let alone Serak, so I couldn't pass up
  the opportunity to train with Guru Nyk. The knowledge and training I
  recieved will keep me busy for years to come. Guru Nyk is very passionate
  about Serak and has a deep knowledge base and understanding of the art.
  On top of that he is a great educator and can effectively translate that
  knowledge into understandable and manageable chunks. If you have the
  opportunity I highly recommend training with Guru Nyk
