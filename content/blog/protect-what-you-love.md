The Indonesian term for the indigenous fighting arts of Java, Sumatra, Madura, Bali, Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, Southern Thailand and other islands in the Indonesian Archipelago (Nusantara) is _Pencak Silat_. _Pencak_ (or _pentjak_ in the old spelling) refers to distinct prearranged patterns of movement, whereas _silat_ refers to the act of fighting. _Pencak Silat_, therefore, literally means "fighting patterns". There are other fighting arts practiced within the Nusantara particularly certain arts of Chinese origin: these are referred to collectively as _Kuntao_ (way of the fist), but the indigenous systems of _silat_ are distinct from _Kuntao_ in that they assume combat will involve bladed weapons and so even when one is forced to fight without any weapons at all (empty-handed) a trained _pesilat_ will always assume opponents will have weapons that may be deployed against them at any time. As such, _Silat_ is always weapon-aware, and especially aware of bladed weapons.

Another important term is _beladiri_. In Malay this word is used generically to refer to martial arts and one meaning in the Indonesian variation of Malay (Bahasa Indonesia) is as an adjective that can describe anything that is "martial" in nature. However, in Indonesia the word is most often used to refer to "self-defense" (_pembelaan diri_). It is in this specific meaning that we use the word _beladiri_ in Pukulan Pencak Silat Serak.
